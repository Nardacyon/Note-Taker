    This app is deployed with Heroku CLI. The purpose of this app is to allow users to save, view, and delete notes. The Note Taker app is run on an express server that use the GET, POST, DELETE methods to fulfill the functionality of the app. To save a note, click on the edit icon in the top right corner of the app, fill both the title and text areas. To save, both of the textareas must be filled in order for the save icon to appear on the left of the edit icon. After saving the note can be viewed on the left panel where the title of the note is displayed in a list of all other saved notes. To delete, hover over the note that you want to delete and click on the red trash icon. All of these functions rewrite and edit to a JSON file that holds an array of saved notes.
